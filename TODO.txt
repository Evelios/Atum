Issues:
  - There is a Diagram bug where center.neighbors are getting created with
    x:NA, y:NA values and are being added to the neighbors list
  
Short Term ToDo:
  - Graph Seach (Basic building block)
  - Graph Search Testing
  - Dark Theme Modification
  - Grunt npm prepublish
  - Center vs Centroid of a polygon

Longer Term ToDo:
  - Profiling
  - PCGComponent
    + Abstract Base Class
    + Holds data and can be manipiulated by feeding in object data

Diagram
  - Use ES6 standards
  - Recursive divisions
    + Voronoi recursion
    + Simple subdivisions
    + L-Systems divisions
  - Diagram traversal
    + A-star
    + Dijkstra

Utilities
  - Point Distributions
    + Hexagonn
    + Circular
    + Recursive Wang Tiles

Shapes modules
  - Basic Classes
    + Polygon
    + Square
    + Circle
    + Triangle

  - Shape Modufications
    + Inset
    + Outset
    + Perturb
  
Town Generation
  - Roads
  - Town Shape
  - Rivers
  - Town Subdivision
  - Districts / Wards / Borough
    + Resursive subdivision

Instance "Battle Map" Generation
  - Low priority

Rendering
  - SVG creation and rendering library
