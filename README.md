# Atum Procedural Generation Library

Atum is a graph based procedural generation library build for Javascript. The approach to this library is to make as little assumptions as possible about the content that is being generated. The only main assumption is that the generative structure is based off a graph structure.

## Instillation

```.bash
git clone https://github.com/Evelios/Atum.git
```

## Attributions

Without the support of these other projects I would be writting a lot more code than I would like to be. This project is built off of their hard work.
